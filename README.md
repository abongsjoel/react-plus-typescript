# React Plus Typescript

> A simple application built while extending my knowledge on Typescript

<!-- ![screenshot](../features/screenshot.png) -->

The project starts by setting up webpack to work with Typescript and then adding react and react-dom to the mix.
Typescript is setup using either ts-loader or babel-loader.

Then, I setup css in webpack and then configure CSS Modules.

Next, I set up a webpack loader for SVG files and describe .svg imports to Typescript

Then, I proceeded in creating functional as well as class based components coupled with looking at handling events using react.

Next, i added React context and the useState hook and then went further to replace setState with useReducer

I proceeded by making use of localstorage to store some data and then call it in the useEffect hook.

Next, i created a Higher Order Component (HOC) for sharing the state, and then a Render Props component as well as a Custom Hook.

I also made use of the React Ref API to handle DOM events using the original DOM API.
